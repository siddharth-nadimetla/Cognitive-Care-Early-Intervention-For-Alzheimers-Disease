# Cognitive Care: Early Intervention For Alzheimer's Disease

Welcome to the project repository for "Cognitive Care: Early Intervention For Alzheimer's Disease". This project aims to develop a predictive model for Alzheimer's Disease using MRI scans, facilitating early intervention and care.

## Introduction

Alzheimer's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and care. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict Alzheimer's Disease progression based on MRI scans.
